Z1 stores the feature vectors for every word in the vocabulary and will be used to vectorize the posts later on. Word2Vec is a 2 layer neural net that processes text and converts it to numerical form. Moreover, since it is an unsupervised learning technique, both labeled and unlabeled reviews can be passed to it to create the training set, thus more training data can be used and nothing is wasted."

The shape of Z2 is (3000000, 300). Using this model as it is will be very computationally expensive so the workaround was to filter out the words which did not occur as part of the movie posts. This would reduce the vocabulary to a great extent as the movie posts are much lesser in number. However, this would result in reduction of accuracy of the model performance. Since I had ample time to let my models work, I decided to continue using the pre-trained model as it is."

Each of the X1-X4 matrices have been split into training and testing sets in an 80-20 manner. I have used trial and error to get the best performing model. Random Forests are basically collections of decision trees which perform better when applied as a collection. I have kept the number of trees as the testing parameter varying it from 5 to 100 in steps of 5. For each parameter, I am calculating the cross val score on the training data set also applying a cross validation of 5 to it. I am keeping a tally of the best cross val score seen till date and the corresponding number of trees. At the end, I am using the best performing parameter to re-train an RF classifier with the training data set and then test it on the testing dataset to get the values in order to plot the ROC curves for each classifier.\n",

    "CONCLUSION\n",
    "\n",
    "On the whole, the LDA model with 20 topics is performing the best. This is however, worse than the simple bag of words approach used in the first assignment which gave high results such as 0.88-0.90. This could be because bag of words model does not take into consideration grammar or word order and is built using the words in each of the reviews itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Techniques to improve efficacy of the classifiers are:\n",
    "1. Increasing the number of topics used in the LDA models. After all, the number of topics is the number of features and increasing the number of features is a way to improve accuracy of machine learning models. With such a vast sized data set, 10 and 20 features will indeed be less and not accurately demonstrate the similarity between words.\n",
    "2. Increasing the number of clusters used during K means clustering. With more number of clusters, more similar words are grouped together better and thus have a better indication at which words are alike.\n",
    "3. Classifier tuning can always be done to better its performance. By including the maximum depth of the tree or the minimum number of samples required to be a leaf node or even weighting the trees to perform a sort of boot strapping, the accuracy of the model could have been improved. Even tuning the previous models like the LDA model could result in better performance."
