# Word2Vec_and_LDA_Modelling
Creating a Word2Vec representation of movie posts using own model and pre-trained Google model. Also perform LDA topic modelling on the data. Then perform classification using Random Forest classifiers.

- Creating vector representations of the movie posts training data using own model and pre-trained Google model.
- Perform K-means clustering and featurize to produce design matrices.
- Perform LDA topic modeling with n_topics = 10 and 20.
- Use random forest classifiers on all the design matrices and plot the ROCs to analyze which featurization technique works best for sentiment classification.
